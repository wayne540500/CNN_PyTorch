Iris Classification with Neural Networks
Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of neural networks to classify the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The notebook utilizes PyTorch, a popular library for building neural networks, and presents a concise yet comprehensive workflow including data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib
You can install the necessary libraries using:

pip install torch pandas matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository_url>
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook CNN.ipynb to see the neural network in action:

jupyter notebook CNN.ipynb
How It Works
The notebook includes:

Data loading and preprocessing: The Iris dataset is loaded and preprocessed for training.
Model building: A neural network model is defined using PyTorch.
Training: The model is trained on the Iris dataset.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test set.
